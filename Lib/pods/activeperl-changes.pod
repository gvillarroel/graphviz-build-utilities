The following security vulnerabilities have been addressed:

=over

=item CVE-2016-1238

The tools and many modules supplied in core no longer search the default current
directory entry in @INC for optional modules. For example, Storable will remove
the final "." from @INC before trying to load Log::Agent.

This prevents an attacker injecting an optional module into a process run by another
user where the current directory is writable by the attacker, e.g. the /tmp directory.

In most cases this removal should not cause problems, but difficulties were encountered
with base, which treats every module name supplied as optional. These difficulties have
not yet been resolved, so for this release there are no changes to base. The Perl team
hopes to have a fix for base in Perl 5.24.2.

Please see L<perldelta> for more information on how to protect your own code from this
attack.

=item CVE-2016-6185

XSLoader contained a security hole in which binary files could be loaded from
a path outside of @INC.

Significant changes that have occurred in the Perl 5.24.1 release are

I<What's new in the 2400 Series>

=over 3

=item *

This build corresponds to the Perl 5.24.0 source code release.

=item *

The 2400 series builds of ActivePerl are not binary compatible with
builds in the 2200 or earlier series.  Any extensions built using binaries
from the ActivePerl 2200 or earlier series will need to be recompiled.
Note especially that this applies to PPM packages that may have been
built for earlier series of ActivePerl.

=item *

Significant changes that have occurred since the 5.22 release are documented in
L<perl5240delta>.
